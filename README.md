# DetectCanaryTokens
Find Canary Tokens is a CLI script designed to search through files in a specified directory for potential canary tokens (URLs typically used as honeypots to detect unauthorized access). The script reads through each file in the directory and its subdirectories, identifies URLs, and logs them into a designated text file.

## Note: 

* This script natively runs within a Unix/Linux enviorment. For Windows enviorments, users must run this script within a Virtual Machine (e.g VMWare, Virtual Box, Hyper-V, ect.), Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), or Gitbash.
